## Description

This is the UI which runs ML Classfication algorithms against the Titanic Passengers data retreived from the API. Currently, Naive Bayes and Neural Networks are the two classification algorithms which predict survival rates of titanic passengers based on inputs such as age, fare, passengers class and gender. Charting is also provided which shows different attributes.
